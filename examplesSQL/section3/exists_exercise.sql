-- Exercise 2
/*
 Modify your query from Exercise 1 as follows:

Select all records from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table such that there is at least one item in the order with an order quantity greater than 500, AND a unit price greater than $50.00.

Select ALL columns from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table for display in your output.

Even if you have aliased this table to enable the use of a JOIN or EXISTS, you can still use the SELECT * shortcut to do this. Assuming you have aliased your table "A", simply use "SELECT A.*" to select all columns from that table.
